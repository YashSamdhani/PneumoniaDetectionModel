# Pneumonia Detection Model
Pneumonia is a disease that spreads quickly and poses a serious risk to the health and well-being of its victims. An accurate biomedical diagnosis of pneumonia necessitates the use of various diagnostic tools and the evaluation of various clinical features, all of which are hindered by the lack of available experts and tools.

The main objective behind this project is to solve a complex process of detecting pneumonia and to provide a simple and faster approach in the field of medicine.
